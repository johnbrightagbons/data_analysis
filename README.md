# Overview

This Python project is a comprehensive sales analysis tool designed to help business analysts quickly evaluate monthly sales performance. As a software developer looking to improve my data analysis skills, I created this project to demonstrate practical application of Python's data manipulation and visualization capabilities.

The project processes sales transaction data from a CSV file and calculates key financial indicators including total revenue, profit, profit margins, and month-over-month growth trends. It generates clear visualizations to reveal patterns in sales performance and profitability. The analysis automatically identifies best-performing months and above-average revenue periods, providing actionable insights for business strategy.

This is a complete end-to-end analysis tool because it includes:
Auto dataset generation (creates sample data if no file exists)
Data validation and cleaning
Financial metric calculations
Trend analysis and visualization
Export functionality for reporting

# Development Environment

The project was developed on the Visual Studio Code using Python programming language. The project used 4 core python library of pandas for data manipulation and analysis, matplitlib for data visualization, os for file manipulation, and datatime for time operations. It follows python best practices of modular code structure, error handling, data validation and cleaning and self explanatory comments.
