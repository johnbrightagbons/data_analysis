# Overview

This python project is a sale analysis designed to help data anaysts to quickly evaluate monthly sale performance. As a software developer looking to improve on my data analysis skills, I wrote this project to demonstrate practical application of python's manipulation and visualization capabilities.

The project processes sales data from a CSV file, calculates the key financial metrics like profit, revenue, profit margin and generates a visulization to highlight performances and or trends. It automatically shows high performing months and gives a complete break down of the monthly index. This is a complete end to end analysis tool because it includes auto data validation, cleaning and export functionality.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The project was developed on the Visual Studio Code using Python programming language. The project used 4 core python library of pandas for data manipulation and analysis, matplitlib for data visualization, os for file manipulation and datatime for time operations. It follows python best practices of modular code structure, error handling, data vaalidation and cleaning and self explanatory comments.
